<p>The locator is an array of block hash identifiers whose purpose is to communicate a position in a blockchain that may be forked from the blockchain that the receiver sees as having the most work.  It does so by providing a series of block hash identifiers ranging from the desired height to the genesis block.  The locator solves both major currency forks and minor forks caused by near-simultaneous block discovery.</p>
<p>The first hash in the locator is the parent of the desired identifiers.  Subsequent elements are ancestors of previous elements, chosen by the client.  A common strategy is to provide M direct ancestors and then make the M+Nth element the 2^Nth ancestor, finishing with the genesis block.  This results in an amount of data that is approximately the log of the length of the chain (<a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/blob/eb264e627e231f7219e60eef41b4e37cc52d6d9d/src/chain.cpp#L32">C++</a>).</p>
<p>The response will begin at <strong>the child of</strong> the first hash in the locator list that matches a block hash identifier held by the responder.  If no hashes match, the response will begin at block height 1 (child of the genesis block).</p>
<p>If the locator has no entries, the locator is ignored (see Stop At Hash).</p>
<p><em>Use a valid locator whose first element is your chain tip and a zero “Stop At Hash” to request up to 2000 headers that extend your chain tip.</em></p>
<h3 id="stop-at-hash">Stop At Hash</h3>
<p>If a non-empty locator is provided, when constructing a response message, the sender will stop at the provided hash.  If the hash is never encountered, the sender will stop after 2000 block hash identifiers are included in the reply.</p>
<p>If the locator is empty, the response includes only the header identified by this field (note it  <strong>includes</strong> this hash, which differs from the behavior of the locator).  In this case, if this hash is not found in the blockchain, the request is silently ignored.</p>
<p><em>Use an empty locator and a valid block hash identifier to request the header of a specific block.</em></p>
